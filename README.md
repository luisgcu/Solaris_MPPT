#Code
The microprocessor using in this project is the TI MSP430G2553 which is standing in the TI MSP430 Launchpad. C code to run the MPPT using the Perturb and Observe algorithm can be found in the Code folder. This is setup as a TI CodeComposer project.

#Electrical Hardware
Designs for the Cuk DC-DC converter, sensors, and printed circuit board for this project as well as datasheets for components can be found in the Electrical Hardware folder. 
*Note that the PCB design is rev1 which had a few mistakes including miswired pins for the OP-AMP read the Errata file for more info.

#Mechanical Hardware
Designs for a waterproof casing and heat-sink for the design can be found in the Mechanical Hardware folder.

#LTSPICE
Simulations of DC-DC converter and sensors.

#Matlab
Matlab files to calculate component values for Cuk and SEPIC DC-DC converters.

#Final Report Documents
This project was begun as a junior design project at John Brown University, as such a detailed final report and presentation can be seen in this folder.
